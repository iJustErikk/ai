# What is this

These are some projects related to AI. Vector DB is a frontend to an ML model my group developed for my cv classes's final project.

## Incomplete

Mammal sleep analysis is an idea I had from reading a book about sleep. Need to re-analyze data at hand, and take a look at current modeling/data engineering approaches.

dogs_cats_vae is a notebook exploring using vae. had issues generating dogs and cats. tried vgg-based perceptual loss. will revisit.

## More Ideas

- text conditional rl- have an agent navigate a video game environment given text commands. voice commands would be cool too.
- cancer detector app
- video embeddings
